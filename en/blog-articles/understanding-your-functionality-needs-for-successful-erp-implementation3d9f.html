          <span><div class="blog-post__meta">One of the keys to a successful enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation is to fully understand the specific functionality your organization requires from the software.</div>
<div class="blog-post__body">
<p>Remember, ERP systems are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Choosing the right ERP for your specific needs is crucial.</p>
<p>Prior to configuring and implementing an ERP solution, an organization will first need to define what it actually needs out of the system. This process of documenting business requirements and redesigning business processes is carried out during system evaluation and implementation planning. “We find far too many companies who purchase a new ERP solution expecting it to simply fix existing problems,” explains Brian Potts, CEO of ERP Technology Partners. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like this and requires significant effort to define and align the capabilities of the system with the needs of the organization.”<br></p>
<p>A well-implemented ERP can be a game-changer, streamlining operations, boosting efficiency, and empowering data-driven decision-making across your entire organization.</p>
<h2><strong>Core Features Companies are Looking for in ERP Selection</strong></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://softwarepath.com/guides/erp-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Software Path reviewed 1,384 ERP projects for its 2022 ERP Report</a> </span>and found that while there is no single answer across all industries, there are some core features that a majority of organizations are seeking in ERP implementation.</p>
<p>“86 percent of companies require accounting in their ERP as a core feature. Alongside, most companies also require inventory management, purchasing, and sales as a base requirement for their ERP system,” <a href="https://softwarepath.com/guides/erp-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reported Software Path</span></a>. “There has been an increase in the number of companies looking for distribution and shipping/logistics as part of their ERP functionality which could suggest companies are combining systems across departments and focusing on one system that meets all cross-departmental needs.”</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Per the study, core features companies were looking for when selecting ERP included:</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span> </span>Financial management (accounting, budgeting, and forecasting) 86.55 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>Inventory management 78.96 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>Procurement Process and Purchasing 62.58 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>CRM and Sales features 47.83 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>Supply chain management 46.1 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>Distribution 41.43 percent.</li>
<li><span> </span>Shipping logistics 41.21 percent.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Navigating the ERP market can be confusing and exhausting. There are so many variables to consider such as new and exciting functionality, integration needs, data concerns, etc., that understanding options around costs, deployment options, and time needed to implement a new system can cause companies to delay much-needed technology initiatives. “Don’t risk losing competitive edge by endlessly delaying your digital transformation,” explains Potts, “we are here to help.”</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2><strong>A Closer Look at ERP Core Functionalities</strong></h2>
<p><span><span>Let’s take a closer look at how</span> </span>ERP systems tackle the complexities of various functions, ensuring seamless operations and data-driven insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong>Financial Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting:</strong><span> Ditching spreadsheets and manual entries, ERPs streamline accounting with real-time data on financials, receivables, payables, and general ledgers. Automated journal entries, reconciliations, and tax calculations boost accuracy and save time.</span><br><span></span><br><span></span></li>
<li><strong>Budgeting and Forecasting:</strong><span> Gone are the days of siloed data and guesswork. ERPs empower you to build flexible budgets, analyze historical trends, and generate accurate forecasts based on real-time sales, inventory, and cost data. This allows for proactive financial planning and informed decision-making.</span><br><span></span><br><span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong>Inventory Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time visibility:</strong><span> Say goodbye to blind spots. ERPs track inventory levels across warehouses, providing instant insights into stock availability, location, and movement. This eliminates overstocking and understocking, optimizing storage space and purchase orders.</span><br><span></span><br><span></span></li>
<li><strong>Demand forecasting:</strong><span> ERPs analyze sales data and market trends to predict future demand patterns. This allows you to optimize production schedules, maintain ideal inventory levels, and avoid costly stockouts or excess inventory.</span></li>
